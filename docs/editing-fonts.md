# Fonts
formBuilder uses an icon font generated with Fontello. Fontello makes it easy for developers to collaborate by providing an API we can incorporate with our normal build processes.

### Editing
To edit the current icon font, open terminal and run:
```bash
npm run font edit
```

This will open and create a new session on fontello.com where you can choose new icons or upload your own.

### Saving
When finished, click the Save Session button and return to the terminal and type:
```bash
npm run font save
```
