# showCommandButtons
When the option `showCommandButtons` is set to false, the buttons for clearing the form controls, previewing the code and saving the form are not shown. By default the buttons are visible.

## Usage
```javascript
var options = {
      showCommandButtons: false
    };
$(container).formBuilder(options);
```
