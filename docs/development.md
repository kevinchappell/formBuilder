# Development

Here we'll cover a few common tasks developers might face when setting up formBuilder.

## Clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kevinchappell/formBuilder.git form-builder && cd form-builder
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
$ yarn install
```
or
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Local development
Once you've cloned the project and installed it's dependencies you can get a local version running by running:
```bash
$ yarn start
```

This will run the default webpack config and open a new browser tab and that serves a demo of the plugin. This demo can be used to test features and bugs.

## Custom Controls
See the Control and Control Plugin Architecture Documentation to learn about how to create custom controls.
